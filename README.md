# testerization
### Intro
This is prety simple java spring boot app with Vue.js as front end. Front and back are not separated. 

### Purposes
It's application created for DevOps test cases such as "Deploy the app with db accessing". Currently I have an app with front end.

### Features
I need to create modularized application for diffrent purposes for using: 
  - queues
  - storage objects
  - with separated front (cloudfront)
  - microservices (orchestration)
